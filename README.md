# AionBot

## Introduction

AionBot is a Rust-based high concurrency cross platform bot runtime. It is designed to be modular and extensible, with a focus on performance and scalability.

The project name `Aion` is a Hellenistic deity associated with time, the orb or circle encompassing the universe, and the zodiac. The time represented by Aion is unlimited, in contrast to Chronos as empirical time divided into past, present and future.

## Work in progress

This project is still in its early stages of development. The current focus is on the core framework and the initial set of plugins.
